# chordless
## Description
chordless is a MIDI note analyzer that runs on Linux.
Any modern Linux (i.e. with ALSA) version should work.

Tht initial project goals are not yet completed.

### Project Goals
- Display currently "on" notes from a MIDI instrument (done)
- Display chord names matching the note structure (not done)
- Customize displayed info using GUI controls (not done)
- Conform to the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

### Dependencies
- Qt 6.3+ for GUI
- CMake for build
- gtest for unit testing
- ALSA for receiving MIDI events

## Compiling
Requirements (with example Debian/Ubuntu package names):
- CMake (cmake)
- Qt dev files (qt6-base-dev)
- OpenGL dev files required by Qt6 (libgl1-mesa-dev)
- ALSA dev files (libasound2-dev)
- An internet connection, since gtest is downloaded from github during the build

Build instructions
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
ctest # optional, run the unit tests
```
The output binary in the build directory is called `chordless`.

## Usage
Run `chordless` with no arguments. An ALSA port is opened.
Use an ALSA utility such as `aconnectgui` to connect your MIDI instrument to chordless

## Desired features
- Select sharps or flats preference with a UI widget.
- Display note octave as numeric subscript.
- Detect chord patterns and display the chord names.

## Further work
- Select key/mode, for improved chord naming/analysis
- JACK MIDI input
- Resizable window with font scaling
- Make unit testing a separate target
- Consider storing gtest files in repo
