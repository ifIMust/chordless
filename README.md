# chordless
## Description
chordless is a MIDI note analyzer that runs on Linux.
Any modern Linux version (i.e. with ALSA) should work.

The initial project goals are partially completed.

### Project Goals
- Display currently "on" notes from a MIDI instrument (DONE)
- Display chord names matching the note structure (DONE)
- Flesh out supported chords with all typical chord types and inversions (IN PROGRESS)
- Customize displayed info using GUI controls (NOT done)
- Conform to the [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Compiling
Requirements:
- CMake 3.25+
- Ninja build system
- Qt 6.3 dev files
- OpenGL dev files required by Qt6
- ALSA dev files
- Boost program_options and json dev files
- An internet connection, since gtest 1.15.0 is downloaded from github during the build

### Install Dependencies

**Debian/Ubuntu:**
```bash
sudo apt install -y cmake ninja-build qt6-base-dev qt6-declarative-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libasound2-dev libboost-json1.81-dev libboost-program-options1.81-dev
```

**Fedora:**
```bash
sudo dnf install -y cmake ninja-build qt6-qtbase-devel qt6-qtdeclarative-devel mesa-libGL-devel alsa-lib-devel boost-devel libstdc++-static
```

### Build Instructions

**Release Build:**
```bash
cmake --workflow --preset release
# Binary location: build/release/chordless
```

**Debug Build (with tests and coverage):**
```bash
cmake --workflow --preset debug
# Binary location: build/debug/chordless
# Run tests: ctest --test-dir build/debug
# Coverage report: ./coverage_summary.sh
```

## Usage
In addition to compile dependencies, `qml6-module-qtquick-templates` is used at runtime.

Running `build/release/chordless` from the project root will use the provided `chords.json` config file.
Use `chordless -c FILE_NAME` to specify a different chord configuration or path.

An ALSA MIDI input port is opened when the application launches.
Use an ALSA utility such as `aconnectgui` to connect your MIDI instrument to chordless.
Notes are read from all MIDI channels, and all other MIDI traffic is ignored.

### Testing without MIDI Hardware
For testing without a physical MIDI device, see [notespew/README.md](notespew/README.md).

## Development

### Testing
The project includes comprehensive unit tests using Google Test:
```bash
# Run all tests
cmake --workflow --preset debug

# Check test coverage (requires debug build)
./coverage_summary.sh
```

### Architecture
The codebase is organized into several modules:
- **note/**: Note naming, event handling, and observation
- **chord/**: Chord matching and analysis
- **input/**: ALSA MIDI input handling
- **settings/**: Configuration management

Key components:
- `NoteObserver`: Base class for note change notifications
- `ChordMatcher`: Analyzes note patterns to identify chords
- `ScientificNoteNamer`: Converts MIDI notes to scientific notation (e.g., "Câ‚„")

## Planned steps
- Deploy as portable AppImage package that includes dependencies
- Toggle numeric subscript visibility with a UI widget
- Use a config file for general program settings

## Further work
- Select key/mode, for improved chord naming/analysis.
- JACK MIDI input
- Sustain checkbox: Keep notes on, respecting sustain pedal.
- Bass chords only
  - Apply chord detection only to lowest matching pattern.
  - Would match chords to the prevailing harmony (left hand) without being muddled by the melody (right hand).
  - Control this setting with a UI widget.
